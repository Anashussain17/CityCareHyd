**CityCare Hyd** is a civic issue reporting platform designed to make **Hyderabad cleaner and safer** by bridging the gap between **citizens and local authorities**.
It allows users to **report civic problems** - such as potholes, garbage accumulation, water supply issues, or damaged streetlights - with just a few taps.
Each report is made visible to local authorities who can respond, upload resolution proofs, and ensure accountability.
